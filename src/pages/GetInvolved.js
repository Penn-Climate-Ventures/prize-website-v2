                Sponsoring the UPenn EcoVenture Challenge empowers future leaders to tackle the

                The UPenn EcoVenture Challenge would not be possible without our sponsors. Thank you
                to our current sponsors for supporting impactful ideas and driving a sustainable
                future.

                Judges are essential to hosting a successful UPenn EcoVenture competition. By
                serving as a judge, youâ€™ll empower student entrepreneurs to bring their ideas to
                life.
              </p>
              <p>
                You would also be given the opportunity to become a mentor for participants in the
                competition. As a mentor, you would be responsible for .... (ask J&P exact
                logistics).
              </p>
              <p>
                We are recruiting judges for each of the three rounds: written application, slide
                deck, and live pitch judging. We extend our gratitude to all past and current judges
                for their invaluable contributions.
